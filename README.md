# Java-Music-Album-info

Within the ‘albums’ data file, there are 20 entries that each represent a single album. On the first line of each album entry there are six data fields
representing the following information (in order): the current sales ranking, the title of the album, the name of the artist, the year the album was
released, and the total number of sales to date (‘M’ denotes million and ‘K’ denotes thousand). The first line is then followed by the list of song tracks
for the album (one per line, in the original published order), with each track indicating the duration of the song (minutes:seconds) in braces. Each album
entry is separated by a dashed line in the text file.

You are required to implement a Java class to represent an album. The program should parse the data file, create an object for each album, and store all 
the objects into a suitable collection. Figure 3 provides a partial UML class representation of the class that you will need to implement. It indicates 
required data members and accessor (i.e., getter) methods that map to those data members, and a toString() method. It is left to you to determine class
data types and how the Album objects should be initialised.
